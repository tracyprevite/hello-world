This is my description of my change and the reason why I made changes to the Master readme file. Adding info and am confused why I don't have to comment-out or "markdown" this information. Also, I wonder if my double quotes will mess something up. I clicked on the README.md file and I wonder if this is the master since I am not seeing that I am in the readme-edits branch.
